# Google Page

This project is the first assignment on building a web page from scratch, replicating Google`s home search page.

## Learning Outcomes

So far, The Odin Project has been an excelent path to follow in learning Web Development. The main achievements I got sofar are the following:

* Development workflow: Setting up a git repository and main stages of development.
* HTML and CSS basics: Overview of main HTML tags, how to structure the page content, and style it properly with CSS.
* The use of developer tools to debug your style.
